# Supply-chain rules for Bazel

This repository contains Bazel modules for injecting and collecting supply-chain metadata into builds.

  - [Documentation](./docs)
  - Modules
    - [@package_metadata](./metadata)

This project is the successor to [rules_license](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_license).

The intended use cases are:
- declaring metadata about packages, such as
  - the licenses the package is available under
  - the canonical package name and version
  - copyright information
  - ... and more TBD in the future
- gathering license declarations into artifacts to ship with code
- applying organization specific compliance constriants against the
  set of packages used by a target.
- producing SBOMs for built artifacts.

> [!WARNING]
> The code here is still in active initial development and will churn a lot.

## Background reading:

These are for learning about the problem space, and our approach to solutions. Concrete specifications will always appear in checked in code rather than documents.
